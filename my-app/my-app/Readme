# Quick run down

Each page is a different js file inside the pages folder that exports a react component.
To link to other pages you have to use the Link tag, which I've used a bit so you can see how i did it
If you have any questions let me know, but so far it should be self explanatory. 

when adding a page, you have to add it to next.config.json like this
          '/': { page: '/' },
          '/Data': {page: '/Data'},
          '/newPage': {page: '/newPage'},

to run its the usual

start with:
`npm install`

then

`npm run dev`

to run it

use `npm run build` 

then `npm run export`

This will create files for you to put on a webserver in the out folder
